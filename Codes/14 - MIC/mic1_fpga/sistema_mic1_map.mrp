  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

Total CPU time to MAP completion:   6 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Section 1 - Errors
------------------

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:MapLib:310 - Clock Feedback Frequency cannot be determined for DCM_SP
   symbol "Inst_divisore_freq/DCM_SP_inst" (output signal=ck_signal1).
   CLK_FEEDBACK is set to 1X by default.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <load_IBUF> is incomplete. The signal
   does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:739 - Unexpected DCM feedback loop. The signal ck_IBUFG
   on the CLKFB pin of comp Inst_divisore_freq/DCM_SP_inst is not driven by an
   IOB or BUFGMUX therefore the phase relationship of output clocks to CLKIN
   cannot be guaranteed.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network load_IBUF has no load.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   3 block(s) optimized away

Section 5 - Removed Logic
