Mapping design into LUTs...
WARNING:MapLib:310 - Clock Feedback Frequency cannot be determined for DCM_SP
   symbol "Inst_divisore_freq/DCM_SP_inst" (output signal=ck_signal1).
   CLK_FEEDBACK is set to 1X by default.
Running directed packing...
Running delay-based LUT packing...

Updating timing models...
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <load_IBUF> is incomplete. The signal
   does not drive any load pins in the design.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:739 - Unexpected DCM feedback loop. The signal ck_IBUFG
   on the CLKFB pin of comp Inst_divisore_freq/DCM_SP_inst is not driven by an
   IOB or BUFGMUX therefore the phase relationship of output clocks to CLKIN
   cannot be guaranteed.

Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,113 out of   2,448   45%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,113 out of   1,113 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,113   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       1,891 out of   4,896   38%
    Number used as logic:             1,568
    Number used as a route-thru:         66

      (Two LUTs used per 32x1 RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:       1

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

    IOB Flip Flops:                      16
  Number of RAMB16s:                      1 out of      12    8%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     1 out of      24    4%
  Number of DCMs:                         1 out of       4   25%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.86

Peak Memory Usage:  595 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  6 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   6 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
