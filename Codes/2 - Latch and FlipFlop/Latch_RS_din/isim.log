Simulator is doing circuit initialization process.
Finished circuit initialization process.
ERROR: at 20 ns(10000): Iteration limit 10000 is reached. Possible zero delay oscillation detected where simulation can not advance in time because signals can not resolve to a stable value in File "/home/luca/ISE_ws/Latch_RS/Latch_RS.vhf" Line 53. Please correct this code in order to advance past the current simulation time.

INFO: Simulator is stopped.
